Respecto a los valores nulos, son 3 las columnas que sí poseen valores nulos, las que corresponden a las columnas numéricas con las notas de los alumnos. Específicamente se tienen 40 nulos en la columna de \"math score\", 40 nulos en \"reading score\" y 47 nulos en \"writing score\". Por otro lado, se tienen 247 filas con nombres duplicados en el dataset. \n","\n","Del boxplot se observan distintos puntos importantes en los datos. Se ve que la mediana de cada uno de ellos está cerca del 75, lo cual a pesar de que es un valor \"alto\" (considerando que las notas van de 0 a 100) no es un valor que indique una anomalía de por sí. Lo extraño se puede ver de mejor manera en que el tercer cuartil de cada uno de los boxplots está alrededor del número 100, lo que da a entender que existe un 25% de los datos que, aproximadamente, tiene notas superiores a 100, lo cual no tiene sentido porque 100 es la calificación más alta. De hecho, se ve que el \"maximum\" de los boxplots está alrededor del valor 150. Incluso, se logran visualizar bastantes outliers, que son los puntos negros sobre los boxplots, que indican que hay valores que están muy cercanos al 200. Todo esto marca que existe una clara anomalía respecto a las notas, ya que estas deberían estar entre el 0 y el 100, ya que corresponden a porcentajes de logro, pero existen mucho valores que no cumplen con esto.\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"bd96201e4e1b434fb5cd0de297147cff","deepnote_cell_height":52.390625,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"45jxMTJHNPC3"},"source":["**Respuesta
