    "**Giturra**, un banquero astuto y ambicioso, estableció su propio banco con el objetivo de obtener enormes ganancias. Sin embargo, su reputación se vio empañada debido a las tasas de interés usureras que imponía a sus clientes. A medida que su banco crecía, Giturra enfrentaba una creciente cantidad de préstamos impagados, lo que amenazaba su negocio y su prestigio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para abordar este desafío, Giturra reconoció la necesidad de reducir los riesgos de préstamo y mejorar la calidad de los préstamos otorgados. Decidió aprovechar la ciencia de datos y el análisis de riesgo crediticio. Contrató a un equipo de expertos para desarrollar un modelo predictivo de riesgo crediticio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cabe señalar que lo modelos solicitados por el banquero deben ser interpretables. Ya que estos le permitira al equipo comprender y explicar cómo se toman las decisiones crediticias. Utilizando visualizaciones claras y explicaciones detalladas, pudieron identificar las características más relevantes, le permitirá analizar la distribución de la importancia de las variables y evaluar si los modelos son coherentes con el negocio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para esto Giturra les solicita crear un modelo de riesgo disponibilizandoles una amplia gama de variables de sus usuarios: como historiales de crédito, ingresos y otros factores financieros relevantes, para evaluar la probabilidad de incumplimiento de pago de los clientes. Con esta información, Giturra podra tomar decisiones más informadas en cuanto a los préstamos, ofreciendo condiciones más favorables a aquellos con menor riesgo de impago.\n"
